🗺️ **NAVIGATION MAP**
📖 This research paper has been broken into {num_chunks} bite-sized sections
⏱️ Estimated reading time: {num_chunks * 2} minutes
🎯 Look for highlighted **KEY POINTS** and 🔺**IMPORTANT CHANGES**
🧠 Brain breaks are built in every 3 sections
📍 Progress indicators show how far you’ve come

💡 **ADHD Reading Tips:**
• Read at your own pace - no rush!
• Use the TL;DR summaries if you need quick overviews
• Take the brain breaks - they help retention
• Come back to sections if your mind wanders
• You’ve got this! 💪

The present study investigated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
interventions for adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 127 participants diagnosed with
ADHD. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CBT intervention group
(n=64) or the waitlist control group (n=63). The CBT intervention consisted of
12 weekly sessions focused on executive functioning skills, time management,
and organization strategies. Results indicated statistically significant
improvements in ADHD symptoms as measured by the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale
(ASRS-v1.1) for the intervention group compared to controls (p<0.001, Cohen’s d=0.82).
Additionally, participants in the CBT group demonstrated significant improvements
in executive functioning as assessed by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive
Function-Adult version (BRIEF-A). These findings suggest that CBT interventions
can be highly effective for managing ADHD symptoms in adults. The study provides
evidence for the implementation of structured CBT programs in clinical settings
for adult ADHD treatment.
